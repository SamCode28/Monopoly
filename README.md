This is a minimally viable product.
I will be using this as practice to save previous versions of my code to default to when I break my program. 
The current version operates as you would expect a regular game of Monopoly would, but it does not have a condition to end the game.
I will be working to add new features in the near future.

To play:
Select how many players you would like.
Choose a gamepiece for each player.
Roll the dice to start your turn.
Follow on screen prompts to intereact with the game board.
End turn to change move to next players turn.
The game ends when you break it or give up.
